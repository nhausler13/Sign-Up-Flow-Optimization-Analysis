# CASE STUDY: Optimizing Sign-Up and Login Processes for 365DataScience.com

Sign-up processes can make or break customer acquisition. 365DataScience is an online learning platform for data science, offering lessons, quizzes, exercises, exams, gamified features, and a newsfeed. The platform requires subscription-based accounts, so optimizing sign-up and login flows is critical for user experience and revenue growth.

## Sign-Up and Login Flow Overview

- **Registration Options:**  
  1. Manual registration (email/password)  
  2. Social media login (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn)  

- **Potential Issues:** Visitors may encounter errors during sign-up or login.  

**Key Metrics to Track:**  
- Visitor-to-Registered Conversion Rate  
- Devices and Operating Systems used  
- Preferred Sign-Up & Login Types  
- Error Messages

## Basic Terminology

- **Visitors:** Individuals who visit the website but have not registered.  
- **Users:** Registered individuals on the platform.  
- **Customers:** Users with access to premium features (paying subscribers).  

**Performance Metrics:**  
- **Sign-Up Success Rate:** Successful sign-ups √∑ Total sign-up attempts  
- **Visitor-to-Registered Conversion Rate:** Successful sign-ups √∑ Total website visitors  

**Benchmark Conversion Rates:**  
- Average online course platform: 2‚Äì5%  
- Software services: ~3%  
- **Note:** High visitor numbers alone do not indicate success; conversion matters.

## Why Optimize the Sign-Up Process?

1. **First Impressions Matter:** Last step before engaging with content; can make or break the user experience.  
2. **Simplicity is Key:** Reduce friction by collecting only essential info upfront (email/password).  
3. **Options for Convenience:**  
   - One-click social media sign-up  
   - Password-less registration  
   - Phone number registration  
   - Auto-fill features (country code, address)  
4. **Behavior Analysis:** Track visitor behavior, identify challenges, and adjust the platform based on real usage.

## Data Preparation & SQL Tables

Using SQL, we created the necessary tables for in-depth analysis and visualization in Tableau.  

The three primary tables for this analysis are:

1. **Conversion Rate**  
   - Tracks the sign-up conversion rate from **July 1, 2022, to January 2023** for all successful registrations.  
   - Key metrics:  
     - Total number of visitors  
     - Number of visitors who registered  
     - Visitors who did not make any direct purchases  
   - Purpose: Indicates overall effectiveness of the sign-up process and highlights opportunities for improving onboarding.

2. **Sign-Up Flow**  
   - Tracks visitor registration attempts, including:  
     - Sign-up method (Email, Google, Facebook, LinkedIn)  
     - Device type (Mobile vs Desktop)  
     - Operating system (Windows, iOS, Android, MacOS)  
     - Success and failure counts for each registration attempt  
   - Purpose: Identifies friction points in the registration process and user preferences.

3. **Login Flow**  
   - Tracks login attempts for registered users, including:  
     - Login method  
     - Device and OS used  
     - Error types encountered  
   - Purpose: Measures post-registration experience and highlights login-related issues.

## üîπ Business Objective

### Focus Metrics
- **Visitor-to-Free Conversion Rate:** Percentage of visitors who register for a free account (did not subscribe within 30 minutes).  
- **Free-to-Paid Conversion Rate:** Percentage of free users who later become paying customers.  

### Why It Matters
- Higher visitor-to-free conversion ‚Üí platform attracts the target audience.  
- Increasing free users ‚Üí expands potential paid customer pool.  
- Optimizing website design and sign-up experience ‚Üí boosts both free and paid conversions.  

### Business Goals
- Maintain steady user growth.  
- Increase % of registered users.  
- Boost visitor-to-free conversion rate.  
- Convert more free users into paid subscriptions.  

---

## üîπ Hypothesis, Opportunity, and Actionable Insights

### 1. Hypothesis
- Website visitors experience problems with **email registration on mobile devices**.  
- Google sign-up is more successful than email; social media options (Facebook/LinkedIn) may be underutilized due to small icon size.  
- **Hypothesis:** Highlighting social media sign-up options and simplifying the registration flow will:
  - Increase visitor-to-free conversion rate.  
  - Lead to more paid subscriptions.  
  - Drive higher revenue and more registered users.
 
### 2. Opportunity Sizing
- **Objective:** Estimate potential growth from implementing the hypothesis.  
- Visitor-to-free conversion rate: currently **2‚Äì5%**, average **3.2%** (excluding November outlier).  
- **Target lift:** 10% ‚Üí raises conversion to **3.52%**.  

**Impact Example (January):**
- Free users: 6,454 ‚Üí 7,099 (+645)  
- Paid subscribers: 213 ‚Üí 234 (+21)  
- Revenue: $6,490 ‚Üí $7,020  

**Revenue Scaling:**  
- Every 10,000 visitors ‚Üí ~14 additional free-to-paid conversions ‚Üí +$420 revenue per 10k visitors  

**Considerations:**  
- Seasonality, marketing campaigns, competition, major events  
- Goal: Ensure improvements align with company objectives and investment is justified

### 3. Actionable Insights
Immediate recommendations to improve sign-up experience:
1. **Emphasize social media sign-up options.**  
2. **Increase prominence/size of social media buttons.**  
3. **Simplify email registration:**
   - Show only ‚ÄúSign up with email‚Äù button initially.  
   - Reduce password complexity requirements.  
   - Simplify password restoration (‚ÄúForgot password‚Äù) process.  
4. **Investigate unknown Facebook signup errors** (collaborate with dev team).  
5. Consider mimicking **Google‚Äôs streamlined, user-friendly design** for email sign-up.

### 4. Expected Results
- Improved user experience across devices  
- Increased visitor-to-registered conversion rate  
- Higher free-to-paid subscription conversions ‚Üí incremental revenue  
- Measurable outcomes validated through **A/B testing** of revised sign-up flow
